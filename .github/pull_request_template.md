## Testing

**You should manually test your PR before merging.**

Example steps to test in Integration:

- Click "Configure" for the [Smokey job][]
- Change the "Branch specifier" to the name of your branch
- Run a new build of the Smokey project and check the results

> This app doesn't have CI setup, and it would be misleading to do so:
> the behaviour of the tests changes depending on the environment they
> are run in.

## Deployment

**You need to manually deploy your PR after merging.**

Steps to deploy a change:

- Run the [Smokey deploy job][] to deploy the [continuous Smokey loop][]
- Repeat this in Staging and Production

> The manual [Smokey job][] will pick up changes on `master` automatically. You only need to do a manual deployment for the [continuous Smokey loop][].
